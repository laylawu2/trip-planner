# trip-planner

Trip Planner is a good starting point on a path to create a fully interactive website where users can choose from a list of hotels, restaurants and activities and arrange their daily iternary in a single-page application. My partner Tiffany and I won "Best Visual Design" competition at Fullstack Academy for this project. I will continue working on Trip Planner by marrying our innovative and responsive front end design with the core functionalities.
